Over-expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae exo-beta-1,3-glucanase gene together with the Bacillus subtilis endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase gene and the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene in yeast.
The EXG1 gene encoding the main Saccharomyces cerevisiae exo-beta-1,3-glucanase was cloned and over-expressed in yeast. The Bacillus subtilis endo-1,3-1,4-beta-glucanase gene (beg1) and the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-beta-1,4-glucanase gene (end1) were fused to the secretion signal sequence of the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor (MF alpha 1S) and inserted between the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase II gene promoter (ADH2P) and terminator (ADH2T). Constructs ADH2P-MF alpha 1S-beg1-ADH2T and ADH2P-MF alpha 1S-end 1-ADH2T designated BEG1 and END1, respectively, were expressed separately and jointly with EXG1 in S. cerevisiae. The construction of fur 1 ura3 S. cerevisiae strains allowed for the autoselection of these multicopy URA3-based plasmids in rich medium. Enzyme assays confirmed that co-expression of EXG1, BEG1 and END1 enhanced glucan degradation by S. cerevisiae.
