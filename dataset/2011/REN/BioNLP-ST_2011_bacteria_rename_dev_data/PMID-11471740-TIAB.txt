Characterization of aspartate kinase III of Bacillus subtilis.
A search in the Bacillus subtilis genome sequence found that the gene designated yclM encode(s) a protein showing significant identity in amino acid sequence to aspartate kinases. When yclM was introduced into Escherichia coli cells deficient in all three aspartate kinase genes, production of a protein with molecular size 50 kDa, which was similar to the value deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene, was observed. Expectedly, the protein purified to homogeneity had aspartate kinase activity. The enzyme was significantly inhibited by simultaneous addition of both threonine and lysine, which is a typical feature of aspartate kinase III of B. subtilis. The enzyme was very unstable in 10 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer, but was stabilized by addition of 500 mM ammonium sulfate. Although all the aspartate kinases so far investigated are oligomeric enzymes, this aspartate kinase was suggested to be a monomer.
