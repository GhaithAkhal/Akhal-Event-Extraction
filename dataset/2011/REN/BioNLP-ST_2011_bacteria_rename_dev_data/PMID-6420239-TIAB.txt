Cloning and expression of the Escherichia coli recA gene in Bacillus subtilis.
By means of homopolymer dG-dC tailing, using PstI linearized pBR327 as vector, we constructed small plasmids containing the entire Escherichia coli recA gene. The 1.8-kb inserts were recloned in the Bacillus subtilis expression vector pPL608 in a B. subtilis recE4 strain. Analysis of plasmid-coded proteins showed expression of the E. coli recA gene both in minicells and whole cells of B. subtilis. Expression was under control of the bacteriophage SP02 promoter, which is part of pPL608. A recA-expressing plasmid completely abolished the transformation deficiency of the recE4 mutant as well as its sensitivity to mitomycin C (MC). The expressed recA gene also restored recombination in other B. subtilis strains lacking the recE gene product. These results indicate a high similarity between the functions of the E. coli RecA and B. subtilis RecE proteins.
