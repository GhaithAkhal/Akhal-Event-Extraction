[RecE-independent recombination of plasmids in Bacillus subtilis cells] The pUB110 and pE194 plasmid cointegrates have been isolated and examined in rec+ and recE4 strains of Bacillus subtilis.
Cointegrates were shown to be formed by recombination at the specific site present on both parental plasmids as a short region of homology designated RSA. The RSA consists of 63 nucleotides in pE194 and 49 in pUB110; the length of its fully conserved core segment is 10 nucleotides. All cointegrates examined were formed by single crossover event taking place within the core segment, and as a result they have identical nucleotide sequences of recombination junctions. No conversion of mismatched base pairs to nucleotide sequences originally belonging to one of the parental plasmids was found. Though the action of RecE gene did not affect the frequency of cointegrate formation, it was reduced in rec149 host by one order of magnitude. Cointegrates retained their stability during transformation.
