A second PDZ-containing serine protease contributes to activation of the sporulation transcription factor sigmaK in Bacillus subtilis.
Gene expression late during the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is governed by a multistep, signal transduction pathway involving the transcription factor sigma(K), which is derived by regulated proteolysis from the inactive proprotein pro-sigma(K). Processing of pro-sigma(K) is triggered by a signaling protein known as SpoIVB, a serine protease that contains a region with similarity to the PDZ family of protein-protein interaction domains. Here we report the discovery of a second PDZ-containing serine protease called CtpB that contributes to the activation of the pro-sigma(K) processing pathway. CtpB is a sporulation-specific, carboxyl-terminal processing protease and shares several features with SpoIVB. We propose that CtpB acts to fine-tune the regulation of pro-sigma(K) processing, and we discuss possible models by which CtpB influences the sigma(K) activation pathway.
