Only one pRNA hexamer but multiple copies of the DNA-packaging protein gp16 are needed for the motor to package bacterial virus phi29 genomic DNA.
A common feature in the maturation of linear dsDNA viruses is that the lengthy viral genome is translocated with remarkable velocity into a limited space within a preformed protein shell using ATP as motor energy. Most biomotors, such as myosin, kinesin, DNA-helicase, and RNA polymerase, contain one ATP-binding component that acts processively. An examination of the well-studied dsDNA viruses reveals that DNA packaging motors involve two nonstructural components. Which component of the motor is the integrated processive factor to turn the motor has not been identified. In bacterial virus phi 29, these two components consist of a gp16 protein and an RNA molecule called pRNA. We have previously predicted and recently confirmed that gp16 binds ATP. It is generally believed that gp16 serves as an ATP-binding and processive component to drive the motor. In this article, phi 29 DNA-packaging intermediates were purified in quantity and examined to differentiate the role between gp16 and pRNA. It was found that the pRNA hexamer is an integral motor component, while gp16 is not stably bound. Only one pRNA hexamer, but multiple copies of gp16, were needed to accomplish DNA packaging. pRNA functions continuously during the entire DNA translocation process, suggesting that pRNA is a vital part of the DNA packaging motor.
