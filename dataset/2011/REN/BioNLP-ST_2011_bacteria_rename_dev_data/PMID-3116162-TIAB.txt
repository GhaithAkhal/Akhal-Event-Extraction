Cloning in Bacillus subtilis by transfection with bacteriophage vector phi 105J27: isolation and preliminary characterization of transducing phages for 23 sporulation loci.
Bacteriophage cloning vector phi 105J27, the construction of which is described in an accompanying paper, has been used for shotgun cloning of sporulation genes in Bacillus subtilis. Various genomic libraries have been constructed and screened for the presence of recombinant phages capable of transducing strains containing sporulation (spo) mutations to Spo+. Of a total of 30 spo loci tested, transducing phages have been isolated for 23, more than half of the known spo loci. Included are nine loci (spo0D, spo0J, spoIIIA, spoIIIE, spoIIIF, spoIVF, spoVB, spoVH and spoVJ) that do not appear to have been cloned previously. Preliminary genetic characterization of some of the new clones by a rapid screening procedure has enabled the status of various sporulation loci to be clarified.
