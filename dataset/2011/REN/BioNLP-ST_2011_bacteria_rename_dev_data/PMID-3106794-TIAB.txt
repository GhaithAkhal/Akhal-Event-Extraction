[Study of the 210-degree region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome using recombinant plasmids] The 210 degrees region of Bacillus subtilis DNA containing the rib operon and genes for the first (dapA) and last (lysA) steps of lysine biosynthesis was cloned.
PstI fragments of B. subtilis m.m. 4.7 MD DNA containing the lys and the proximal part of rib operon were isolated from different B. subtilis strains (SB25 and SHgW) and shown to have the same restriction and genetic maps. The restriction mapping of EcoRI fragment of B. subtilis m.m. 6.3 MD DNA containing the rib operon has been carried out.
