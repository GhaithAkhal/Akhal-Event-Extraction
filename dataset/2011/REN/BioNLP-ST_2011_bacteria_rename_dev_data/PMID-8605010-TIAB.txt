Secretion of active subtilisin YaB by a simultaneous expression of separate pre-pro and pre-mature polypeptides in Bacillus subtilis.
Alkaline elastase YaB, produced by alkalophilic Bacillus YaB, is an extracellular serine protease having 55% homology to subtilisin BPN' and thus could be called subtilisin YaB. It is synthesized as a 378-amino acid preproenzyme and secreted into the culture medium as a 265-amino acid mature protease. To examine if the pro-peptide of subtilisin YaB functions in trans to guide the folding of secreted subtilisin YaB in vivo, we made genes encoding the pre-pro, pro and pre-mature portions and placed them under the control of the spac-1 promoter on a multi-copy plasmid. When simultaneous expression in Bacillus subtilis of both the pre-pro and pre-mature genes was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG), protease activity was detected in the medium. On the other hand, we could not detect protease activity when the expression of either the pre-mature gene alone or both the pro and pre-mature genes was induced. From these results, we concluded that the pro region functions in trans and outside the cells for the proper folding and activation of the enzyme.
