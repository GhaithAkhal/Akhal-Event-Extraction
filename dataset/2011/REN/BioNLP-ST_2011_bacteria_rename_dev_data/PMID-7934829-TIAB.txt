The organization of the Bacillus subtilis 168 chromosome region between the spoVA and serA genetic loci, based on sequence data.
Three different lambda phage clones with overlapping inserts of Bacillus subtilis DNA, which cover the region from spoIIAA to serA, have been isolated. The nucleotide sequence of their inserts, starting after spoVAF and ending at serA, has been determined. A contiguous sequence of 35,354 bp was established, including previously analysed overlapping adjacent regions. Within the newly determined sequence 31 open reading frames (ORFs) with putative ribosome-binding sites have been found. Nine of them correspond to previously sequenced and characterized genes: spo-VAF, lysA, sipS, ribG, ribB, ribA, ribH, ribTD and dacB. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the products encoded by the other ORFs to known proteins allowed putative functions to be assigned to seven of these ORFs. Among these are the following: (i) the ppiB gene, encoding a cytoplasmic peptidylprolyl isomerase; (ii) two pairs of signal-transducers, one homologous to phoR-phoP of B. subtilis, encoding regulators of phosphatase biosynthesis, and the second to the fecI-fecR of Escherichia coli, which is responsible for the regulation of the citrate-dependent iron (III) transport system; (iii) aroC and serA genes, involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and serine, respectively, the function of which has been confirmed by constructing corresponding mutants with disrupted ORFs. The organization of putative operons has been postulated on the basis of the sequences of their transcription terminators, promoters and regulatory elements.
