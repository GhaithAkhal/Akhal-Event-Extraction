Cloning and expression of cadD, a new cadmium resistance gene of Staphylococcus aureus.
A cadmium resistance gene, designated cadD, has been identified in and cloned from the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pRW001. The gene is part of a two-component operon which contains the resistance gene cadD and an inactive regulatory gene, cadX*. A high degree of sequence similarity was observed between cadD and the cadB-like gene from S. lugdunensis, but no significant similarity was found with either cadA or cadB from the S. aureus plasmids pI258 and pII147. The positive regulatory gene cadX* is identical to cadX from pLUG10 over a stretch of 78 codons beginning at the N terminus, but it is truncated at this point and inactive. Sequence analysis showed that the cadmium resistance operon resides on a 3,972-bp element that is flanked by direct repeats of IS257. The expression of cadD in S. aureus and Bacillus subtilis resulted in low-level resistance to cadmium; in contrast, cadA and cadB from S. aureus induced higher level resistance. However, when the truncated version of cadX contained in pRW001 is complemented in trans with cadX from plasmid pLUG10, resistance increased approximately 10-fold suggesting that the cadmium resistance operons from pRW001 and pLUG10 are evolutionarily related. Moreover, the truncated version of cadX contained in pRW001 is nonfunctional and may have been generated by deletion during recombination to acquire the cadmium resistance element.
