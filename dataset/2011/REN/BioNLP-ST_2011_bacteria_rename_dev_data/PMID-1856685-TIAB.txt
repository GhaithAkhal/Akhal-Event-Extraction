Cloning, sequencing, and mutational analysis of the Bradyrhizobium japonicum fumC-like gene: evidence for the existence of two different fumarases.
The Bradyrhizobium japonicum fumarase gene (fumC-like) was cloned and sequenced, and a fumC deletion mutant was constructed. This mutant had a Nod+ Fix+ phenotype in symbiosis with the host plant, soybean, and growth in minimal medium with fumarate as sole carbon source was also not affected. The cloned B. japonicum fumC gene fully complemented an Escherichia coli Fum- mutant, strain JH400, for growth in minimal medium with fumarate. The predicted amino acid sequence of the FumC protein showed strong similarity to the E. coli FumC protein, Bacillus subtilis CitG protein, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fum1 protein, and the mammalian fumarases. The B. japonicum FumC protein accounted for about 40% of the total fumarase activity in aerobically grown cells. The remaining 60% was ascribed to a temperature-labile fumarase. These data suggest that B. japonicum possesses two different fumarase isoenzymes, one of which is encoded by fumC. Besides E. coli, which has three fumarases, B. japonicum is thus the second bacterium for which there is genetic evidence for the existence of more than one fumarase.
