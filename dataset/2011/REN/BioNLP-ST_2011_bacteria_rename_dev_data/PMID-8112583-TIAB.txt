Identification of genes encoding ribosomal protein L33 from Bacillus licheniformis, Thermus thermophilus and Thermotoga maritima.
Three previously unrecognized genes from Bacillus licheniformis, Thermus thermophilus and Thermotoga maritima, encoding ribosomal protein L33, have been identified and designated as rpmG genes. Their sequence and context have been compared with the three known rpmG genes from Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis and B. subtilis. Previously unrecognized open reading frames homologous to secE are located immediately downstream from rpmG in B. licheniformis, T. thermophilus and Ta. maritima: beyond that lie previously identified nusG and rplK genes. Thus, the genes located downstream from rpmG show similar organization across three of the four bacterial phyla represented.
