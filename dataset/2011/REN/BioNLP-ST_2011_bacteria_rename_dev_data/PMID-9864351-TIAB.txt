A novel Bacillus subtilis gene, antE, temporally regulated and convergent to and overlapping dnaE.
A Bacillus subtilis promoter, Px, that functions in a convergent manner with the sigA operon promoter P3 has been found in the sigA operon. Promoter Px is turned on at the same time as promoter P3 during early sporulation. The transcript from promoter Px codes for a small protein with partial homology to the OmpR protein from Escherichia coli and also carries an untranslated sequence at its 3' end that is complementary to the 5' end of the P3 transcript, which codes for the ribosome binding site of dnaE. The gene controlled by Px has been called antE. The expression of antE does not require sigmaB, sigmaE, or sigmaH. Px was transcribed in vitro by the sigmaA holoenzyme and is the seventh promoter to be recognized in the sigmaA operon. A possible role for the antE gene during early sporulation is proposed.
