Identification and nucleotide sequence of the minimal replicon of the low-copy-number plasmid pBS2.
The plasmid pBS2 has a low copy number and is endogenous to Bacillus subtilis. The replication of this plasmid depends on the function of most of the host's dna genes including dnaB, which is unique to B. subtilis and is required for both the initiation of chromosome replication and the DNA-membrane association. We have identified the region that is essential for the replication of pBS2 and determined the complete 2279-bp nucleotide sequence of this region. In this region, there are two stretches of sequence homologous to the 18-bp consensus sequence which commonly appears at the origin of replication of plasmids pUB110 and pC194. The entire region contains six sizable open reading frames. Two of them are probably translated. One open reading frame, designated ORF A, coding for 269 amino acids, has significant homology, in terms of amino acid sequence, with the open reading frame of the gene for the Rep U protein of plasmid pUB110. The similarities between pBS2 and other plasmids suggest that the pBS2 may also replicate as a rolling circle, which appears to be the salient feature of a mechanism of replication that is common to small plasmids in gram-positive bacteria.
