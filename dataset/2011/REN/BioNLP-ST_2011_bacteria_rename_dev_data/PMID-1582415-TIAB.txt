Histone H4-related osteogenic growth peptide (OGP): a novel circulating stimulator of osteoblastic activity.
It has been established that regenerating marrow induces an osteogenic response in distant skeletal sites and that this activity is mediated by factors released into the circulation by the healing tissue. In the present study we have characterized one of these factors, a 14 amino acid peptide named osteogenic growth peptide (OGP). Synthetic OGP, identical in structure to the native molecule, stimulates the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblastic cells in vitro and increases bone mass in rats when injected in vivo. Immunoreactive OGP in high abundance is present physiologically in the serum, mainly in the form of an OGP-OGP binding protein complex. A marked increase in serum bound and unbound OGP accompanies the osteogenic phase of post-ablation marrow regeneration and associated systemic osteogenic response. Authentic OGP is identical to the C-terminus of histone H4 and shares a five residue motif with a T-cell receptor beta-chain V-region and the Bacillus subtilis outB locus. Since these latter proteins have not been implicated previously in the control of cell proliferation or differentiation, OGP may belong to a novel, heretofore unrecognized family of regulatory peptides. Perhaps more importantly, OGP appears to represent a new class of molecules involved in the systemic control of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation.
