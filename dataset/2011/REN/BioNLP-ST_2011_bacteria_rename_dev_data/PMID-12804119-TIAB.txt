First complete nucleotide sequence and heterologous gene organization of the two rRNA operons in the phytoplasma genome.
Phytoplasmas are cell-wallless Gram-positive low G + C bacteria belonging to the Mollicutes that inhabit the cytoplasm of plants and insects. Although phytoplasmas possess two ribosomal RNA (rrn) operons, only one has been fully sequenced. Here, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of both rrn operons (designated rrnA and rrnB) of onion yellows (OY) phytoplasma. Both operons have rRNA genes organized as 5'-16S-23S-5S-3' with very highly conserved sequences; the 16S, 23S, and 5S rRNA genes are 99.9, 99.8, and 99.1% identical between the two operons. However, the organization of tRNA genes in the upstream region from 16S rRNA gene and in the downstream region from 5S rRNA gene differs markedly. Several promoter candidates were detected upstream from both operons, which suggests that both operons are functional. Interestingly, both have a tRNA(Ile) gene in the 16S-23S spacer region, while the reported rrnB operon of loofah witches' broom phytoplasma does not, indicating heterogenous gene organization of rrnB within phytoplasmas. The phytoplasma tRNA gene organization is similar to that of acholeplasmas, a closely related mollicute, and different from that of mycoplasmas, another mollicute. Moreover, the organization suggests that the rrn operons were derived from that of a related nonmollicute bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. This data should shed light on the evolutionary relationships and phylogeny of the mollicutes.
