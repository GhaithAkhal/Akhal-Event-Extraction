Identification of the transcriptional suppressor sof-1 as an alteration in the spo0A protein.
The mutation sof-1 suppresses the sporulation defect of mutations in either the spo0B, spo0E, or spo0F stage 0 sporulation genes. Through the use of integrative plasmids carrying the portion of the chromosome including the spo0A locus and flanking regions, the sof-1 mutation was localized near the spo0A locus. A plasmid carrying a fragment of DNA with sof genetic activity was constructed. Nucleic acid sequence analysis of this fragment revealed a single base change that resulted in a substitution of lysine for asparagine in the 12th codon of the spo0A gene. The results indicate that certain missense mutations in the spo0A gene bypass the necessity for the spo0B, spo0E, and spo0F gene products in sporulation. Several models for the interaction of these gene products may be imagined.
