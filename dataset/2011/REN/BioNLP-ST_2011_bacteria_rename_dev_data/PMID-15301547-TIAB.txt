4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase, its homologue YwhB, and active vinylpyruvate hydratase: synthesis and evaluation of 2-fluoro substrate analogues.
A series of 2-fluoro-4-alkene and 2-fluoro-4-alkyne substrate analogues were synthesized and examined as potential inhibitors of three enzymes: 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) and vinylpyruvate hydratase (VPH) from the catechol meta-fission pathway and a closely related 4-OT homologue found in Bacillus subtilis designated YwhB. All of the compounds were potent competitive inhibitors of 4-OT with the monocarboxylated 2E-fluoro-2,4-pentadienoate and the dicarboxylated 2E-fluoro-2-en-4-ynoate being the most potent. Despite the close mechanistic and structural similarities between 4-OT and YwhB, these compounds were significantly less potent inhibitors of YwhB with K(i) values ranging from 5- to 633-fold lower than those determined for 4-OT. The study of VPH is complicated by the fact that the enzyme is only active as a complex with the metal-dependent 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylase (4-OD), the enzyme following 4-OT in the catechol meta-fission pathway. A structure-based sequence analysis identified 4-OD as a member of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily and implicated Glu-109 and Glu-111 as potential metal-binding ligands. Changing these residues to a glutamine verified their importance for enzymatic activity and enabled the production of soluble E109Q4-OD/VPH or E111Q4-OD/VPH complexes, which retained full hydratase activity but had little decarboxylase activity. Subsequent incubation of the E109Q4-OD/VPH complex with the substrate analogues identified the 2E and 2Z isomers of the monocarboxylated 2-fluoropent-2-en-4-ynoate as competitive inhibitors. The combined results set the stage for crystallographic studies of 4-OT, YwhB, and VPH using these inhibitors as ligands.
