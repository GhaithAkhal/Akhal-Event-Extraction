Control of developmental transcription factor sigma F by sporulation regulatory proteins SpoIIAA and SpoIIAB in Bacillus subtilis.
The sporulation operon spoIIA of Bacillus subtilis consists of three cistrons called spoIIAA, spoIIAB, and spoIIAC. Little is known about the function of spoIIAA and spoIIAB, but spoIIAC encodes a sigma factor called sigma F, which is capable of directing the transcription in vitro of genes that are expressed in the forespore chamber of the developing sporangium. We now report that the products of the spoIIA operon constitute a regulatory system in which SpoIIAA is an antagonist of SpoIIAB (or otherwise counteracts the effect of SpoIIAB) and SpoIIAB is, in turn, an antagonist of SpoIIAC (sigma F). This conclusion is based on the observations that (i) overexpression of spoIIAB inhibits sigma F-directed gene expression, (ii) a mutation in spoIIAB stimulates sigma F-directed gene expression, (iii) a mutation in spoIIAA blocks sigma F-directed gene expression, and (iv) a mutation in spoIIAB relieves the block in sigma F-directed gene expression caused by a mutation in spoIIAA. The SpoIIAA/SpoIIAB/SpoIIAC regulatory system could play a role in controlling the timing of sigma F-directed gene expression and/or could be responsible for restricting sigma F-directed gene expression to the forespore chamber of the sporangium.
