Lambda clone B22 contains a 7676 bp genomic fragment of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome VII spanning the VAM7-SPM2 intergenic region and containing three novel transcribed open reading frames.
A genomic clone of 7676 bp designated B22 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been sequenced. The 5' end matches the previously described gene, VAM7, and the 3' end matches the previously described gene, SPM2, both of which have been assigned to the left arm of chromosome VII. The intergenic region contains three transcribed open reading frames (ORFs). The first is related to an uncharacterized ORF of Bacillus subtilis and more weakly to MesJ in Escherichia coli; this is found as a single transcript of 1.1 kb by Northern blotting. The second ORF encodes a small ras-like GTPase of 222 residues with strong homology to yeast Ypt8p and to mammalian Rab11; this is found as a single transcript of 1.1 kb by Northern blotting. The third ORF generates a transcript of 1.6 kb and encodes a protein of 382 residues including a perfect match to the consensus sequence of a C2H2 zinc finger domain; it shares a strong homology with yeast Mig1p and Cre-A from Aspergillus, Emericella and E. coli. This ORF also has a striking similarity to a putative 43 kDa zinc finger protein encoded by an ORF (YEL8) immediately downstream of YPT8, raising the possibility that a region between VAM7 and SPM2 on chromosome VII arose as a duplication of the YPT8-YEL8 region of chromosome V, followed by a translocation.
