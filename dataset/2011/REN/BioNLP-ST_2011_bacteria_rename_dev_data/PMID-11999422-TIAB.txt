Molecular cloning of the gene encoding thermostable endo-1,5-alpha-L-arabinase of Bacillus thermodenitrificans TS-3 and its expression in Bacillus subtilis.
The gene that encodes a thermostable endo-arabinase (called ABN-TS) from Bacillus thermodenitrificans TS-3 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in the mesophilic B. subtilis. The gene contained an open reading frame consists of 939 bp, which encodes 313 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed 50, 46, and 36% similarity with endo-arabinase from B. subtilis IFO 3134 (PPase-C), Pseudomonas fluorescens (ArbA), and Aspergillus niger (ABNA), respectively. The hydrophobic and acidic amino acids making up ABN-TS outnumbered those in PPase-C. The gene product expressed in B. subtilis, as the host, had substantially the same characteristics, and was stable up to 70 degrees C, and the reaction was optimal around 70 degrees C, as well as native ABN-TS.
