Study of chromosome rearrangements associated with the trpE26 mutation of Bacillus subtilis.
Chromosome rearrangements involved in the formation of merodiploid strains in the Bacillus subtilis 168-166 system were explained by postulating the existence of intrachromosomal homology regions. This working hypothesis was tested by analysing sequences and restriction patterns of the, as yet uncharacterized, junctions between chromosome segments undergoing rearrangements in parent, 168 trpC2 and 166 trpE26, as well as in derived merodiploid strains. Identification, at the Ia/Ib chromosome junction of both parent strains, of a 1.3 kb segment nearly identical to a segment of prophage SPbeta established the existence of one of the postulated homology sequences. Inspection of relevant junctions revealed that a set of different homology regions, derived from prophage SPbeta, plays a key role in the formation of so-called trpE30, trpE30+, as well as of new class I merodiploids. Analysis of junctions involved in the transfer of the trpE26 mutation, i.e. simultaneous translocation of chromosome segment C and rotation of the terminal relative to the origin moiety of the chromosome, did not confirm the presence of any sequence suitable for homologous recombination. We propose a model involving simultaneous introduction of four donor DNA molecules, each comprising a different relevant junction, and their pairing with the junction regions of the recipient chromosome. The resolution of this structure, resting on homologous recombination, would confer the donor chromosome structure to the recipient, achieving some kind of 'transstamping'. In addition, a rather regular pattern of inverse and direct short sequence repeats in regions flanking the breaking points could be correlated with the initial, X-ray-induced, rearrangement.
