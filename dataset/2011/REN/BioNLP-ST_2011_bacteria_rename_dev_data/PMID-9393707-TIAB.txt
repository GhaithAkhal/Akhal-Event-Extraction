Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, catalase, MrgA, and superoxide dismutase are not involved in resistance of Bacillus subtilis spores to heat or oxidizing agents.
Only a single superoxide dismutase (SodA) was detected in Bacillus subtilis, and growing cells of a sodA mutant exhibited paraquat sensitivity as well as a growth defect and reduced survival at an elevated temperature. However, the sodA mutation had no effect on the heat or hydrogen peroxide resistance of wild-type spores or spores lacking the two major DNA protective alpha/beta-type small, acid-soluble, spore proteins (termed alpha(-)beta(-) spores). Spores also had only a single catalase (KatX), as the two catalases found in growing cells (KatA and KatB) were absent. While a katA mutation greatly decreased the hydrogen peroxide resistance of growing cells, as found previously, katA, katB, and katX mutations had no effect on the heat or hydrogen peroxide resistance of wild-type or alpha(-)beta(-) spores. Inactivation of the mrgA gene, which codes for a DNA-binding protein that can protect growing cells against hydrogen peroxide, also had no effect on spore hydrogen peroxide resistance. Inactivation of genes coding for alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, which has been shown to decrease growing cell resistance to alkyl hydroperoxides, had no effect on spore resistance to such compounds or on spore resistance to heat and hydrogen peroxide. However, Western blot analysis showed that at least one alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit was present in spores. Together these results indicate that proteins that play a role in the resistance of growing cells to oxidizing agents play no role in spore resistance. A likely reason for this lack of a protective role for spore enzymes is the inactivity of enzymes within the dormant spore.
