Gene-enzyme relationships of the purine biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus subtilis.
The gene-enzyme relationship has been established for most of the steps of the purine de novo biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus subtilis. The synthesis of inosine monophosphate (IMP) involves ten steps, and the branching from IMP to AMP and to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis both require two steps. To avoid confusion in the nomenclature of the pur genes we have adopted the Escherichia coli system for B. subtilis. The two genes specifying the enzymes catalysing the conversion of IMP to succinyl-AMP (pur A), and the conversion of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate (guaB), occur as single units whilst the other purine genes are clustered at 55 degrees on the B. subtilis linkage map. Based on transformation and transduction studies, and on complementation studies using B. subtilis pur genes cloned in plasmids, the arrangement of some of the clustered genes has been determined relative to outside markers. The following gene order has been established: pbuG-purB-purF-purM-purH-purD-tre. Three other genes were also found to be located in the cluster, guaA, purL and purE/C. However, we were not able to find their exact location. When the purF, purM, purD and purB genes of B. subtilis are present in plasmids they are capable of directing the synthesis in E. coli of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (purF), aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase (purM), glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (purD) and adenylosuccinate lyase (purB), respectively.
