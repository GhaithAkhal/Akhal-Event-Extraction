Sequence and expression of a novel murine interferon alpha gene--homology with enhancer elements in the regulatory region of the gene.
A murine interferon gene (MuIFN alpha) has been isolated from a cosmid library. The sequence of a 1.2-kb HindIII-PstI fragment revealed a new MuIFN alpha gene which has not yet been described and which was termed MuIFN alpha 7. The coding sequence produced biologically active IFN when expressed in monkey cells under the control of an SV40 promoter. A comparison of the MuIFN alpha 7 gene with the known interferon genes in their coding and flanking sequences shows homologies between enhancer elements found in the 5' upstream region of the coding gene. The core element common to all known viral enhancers, GTGG(AAA/TTT)G is repeated four times in the MuIFN alpha 7 5'-flanking region, as in all known MuIFN alpha genes.
