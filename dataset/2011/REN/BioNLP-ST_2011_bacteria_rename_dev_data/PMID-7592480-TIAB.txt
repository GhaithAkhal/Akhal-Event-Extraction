Generation of auxotrophic mutants of Enterococcus faecalis.
A 22-kb segment of chromosomal DNA from Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF containing the pyrimidine biosynthesis genes pyrC and pyrD was previously detected as complementing Escherichia coli pyrC and pyrD mutations. In the present study, it was found that the E. faecalis pyrimidine biosynthetic genes in this clone (designated pKV48) are part of a larger cluster resembling that seen in Bacillus spp. Transposon insertions were isolated at a number of sites throughout the cluster and resulted in loss of the ability to complement E. coli auxotrophs. The DNA sequences of the entire pyrD gene of E. faecalis and selected parts of the rest of the cluster were determined, and computer analyses found these to be similar to genes from Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus caldolyticus pyrimidine biosynthesis operons. Five of the transposon insertions were introduced back into the E. faecalis chromosome, and all except insertions in pyrD resulted in pyrimidine auxotrophy. The prototrophy of pyrD knockouts was observed for two different insertions and suggests that E. faecalis is similar to Lactococcus lactis, which has been shown to possess two pyrD genes. A similar analysis was performed with the purL gene from E. faecalis, contained in another cosmid clone, and purine auxotrophs were isolated. In addition, a pool of random transposon insertions in pKV48, isolated in E. coli, was introduced into the E. faecalis chromosome en masse, and an auxotroph was obtained. These results demonstrate a new methodology for constructing defined knockout mutations in E. faecalis.
