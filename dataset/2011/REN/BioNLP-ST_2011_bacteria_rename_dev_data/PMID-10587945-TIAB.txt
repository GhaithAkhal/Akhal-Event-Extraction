Phylogenetic analyses of proton-translocating transhydrogenases.
The proton-translocating nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases (TH) provide a simple model for understanding chemically coupled transmembrane proton translocation. To further our understanding of TH structure-function relationships, we have identified all sequenced homologous of these vectorial enzymes and have conducted sequence comparison studies. The NAD-binding domains of TH are homologous to bacterial alanine dehydrogenases (ADH) and eukaryotic saccharopine dehydrogenases (SDH) as well as N5(carboxyethyl)-L-ornithine synthase of Lactococcus lactis and dipicolinate synthase of Bacillus subtilis. A multiple alignment, a phylogenetic tree, and two signature sequences for this family, designated the TH-ADH-SDH or TAS superfamily, have been derived. Additionally, the TH family has been characterized. Phylogenetic analyses suggested that these proteins have evolved without inter-system shuffling. However, interdomain splicing-fusion events have occurred during the evolution of several of these systems. Analyses of the multiple alignment for the TH family revealed that domain conservation occurs in the order: NADP-binding domain (domain III) > NAD-binding domain (domain I) > proton-translocating transmembrane domain (domain II). A topologic model for the proton-translocating transmembrane domain consistent with published data is presented, and a possible involvement of specific transmembrane alpha-helical segments in channel formation is suggested.
