Bacillus subtilis SalA (YbaL) negatively regulates expression of scoC, which encodes the repressor for the alkaline exoprotease gene, aprE.
During the course of screening for exoprotease-deficient mutants among Bacillus subtilis gene disruptants, a strain showing such a phenotype was identified. The locus responsible for this phenotype was the previously unknown gene ybaL, which we renamed salA. The predicted gene product encoded by salA belongs to the Mrp family, which is widely conserved among archaea, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. Disruption of salA resulted in a decrease in the expression of a lacZ fusion of the aprE gene encoding the major extracellular alkaline protease. The decrease was recovered by the cloned salA gene on a plasmid, demonstrating that the gene is involved in aprE expression. Determination of the cis-acting region of SalA on the upstream region of aprE, together with epistatic analyses with scoC, abrB, and spo0A mutations that also affect aprE expression, suggested that salA deficiency affects aprE-lacZ expression through the negative regulator ScoC. Northern and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed enhanced levels of scoC transcripts in the salA mutant cells in the transition and early stationary phases. Concomitant with these observations, larger amounts of the ScoC protein were detected in the mutant cells by Western analysis. From these results we conclude that SalA negatively regulates scoC expression. It was also found that the expression of a salA-lacZ fusion was increased by salA deficiency, suggesting that salA is autoregulated.
