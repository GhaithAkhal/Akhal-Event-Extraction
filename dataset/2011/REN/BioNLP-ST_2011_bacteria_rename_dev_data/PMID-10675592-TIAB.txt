The Bacillus subtilis ctaB paralogue, yjdK, can complement the heme A synthesis deficiency of a CtaB-deficient mutant.
Heme A is a prosthetic group in many respiratory oxidases. It is synthesised from heme B (protoheme IX) with heme O as an intermediate. In Bacillus subtilis two genes required for heme A synthesis, ctaA and ctaB, have been identified. CtaB is the heme O synthase and CtaA is involved in the conversion of heme O to heme A. A ctaB paralogue, yjdK, has been identified through the B. subtilis genome sequencing project. In this study we show that when carried on a low copy number plasmid, the yjdK gene can complement a ctaB deletion mutant with respect to heme A synthesis. Our results indicate that YjdK has heme O synthase activity. We therefore suggest that yjdK be renamed as ctaO.
