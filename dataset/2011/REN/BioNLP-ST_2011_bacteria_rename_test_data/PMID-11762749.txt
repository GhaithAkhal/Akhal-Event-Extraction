Bacterial arylsulfate sulfotransferase as a reporter system.
To investigate whether the arylsulfate sulfotransferase (ASST) is suitable as a reporter system for monitoring gene expression, a reporter vector carrying the fragments of the astA coding region without the promoter region was constructed and designated as pSY815. As a test of the ASST reporter system's suitability, the regulatory regions of ermC and lacZ were inserted upstream of the coding region of the reporter gene to generate pSY815-EC and pSY815-LZ, respectively. In the absence of the inserted regulatory regions, the plasmids displayed very low background activities in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The ASST activity under the control of the ermC regulatory region was increased 4.4-fold in B. subtilis when induced by 0.1 microgml(-1) of erythromycin. These results were consistent with a lacZ reporter gene assay of the ermC regulatory region. Furthermore, we confirmed that the lacZ promoter in E. coli was strongly induced to a 17.9-fold increase by 0.05 mM of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in this reporter system. These results indicate that the ASST is a suitable reporter system. The lack of endogenous activity, the simple detection of enzyme activity in the living cell, the commercially available non-toxic substrates, and the high sensitivity make ASST a useful genetic reporter system for monitoring gene expression and understanding gene regulation.
