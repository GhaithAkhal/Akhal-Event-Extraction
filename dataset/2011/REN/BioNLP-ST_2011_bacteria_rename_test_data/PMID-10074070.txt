Functional identification of the product of the Bacillus subtilis yvaL gene as a SecG homologue.
Protein export in Escherichia coli is mediated by translocase, a multisubunit membrane protein complex with SecA as the peripheral subunit and the SecY, SecE, and SecG proteins as the integral membrane domain. In the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, SecA, SecY, and SecE have been identified through genetic analysis. Sequence comparison of the Bacillus chromosome identified a potential homologue of SecG, termed YvaL. A chromosomal disruption of the yvaL gene results in mild cold sensitivity and causes a beta-lactamase secretion defect. The cold sensitivity is exacerbated by overexpression of the secretory protein alpha-amylase, whereas growth and beta-lactamase secretion are restored by coexpression of yvaL or the E. coli secG gene. These results indicate that the yvaL gene codes for a protein that is functionally homologous to SecG.
