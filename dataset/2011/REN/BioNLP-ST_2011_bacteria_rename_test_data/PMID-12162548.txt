Endophytic bacillus sp. isolated from the interior of balloon flower root. A bacterial strain, designated CY22, was isolated from the interior of balloon flower (Platycodon grandiflorum) root in the Republic of Korea. The isolate coproduced an iturin-like antifungal compound and a surfactin-like potent biosurfactant. Analysis of the 16S-rDNA of strain CY22 showed that the isolate was a member of Bacillus. High similarities were observed between strain CY22 and Bacillus sp. TKSP 24, and between strain CY22 and B. subtilis 168. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S-rDNA sequences showed that strain CY22 was closely related to Bacillus sp. The main whole-cell fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (37%), C17:0 (5.1%), and iso-C15:0 (27.7%). DNA G+C content was 54 mol%. Based on phylogenetic inference, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, this endophytic strain Bacillus sp. CY22 was assigned to the genus Bacillus.
