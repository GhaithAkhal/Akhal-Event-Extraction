Two replication determinants of an antibiotic-resistance plasmid, pTB19, from a thermophilic bacillus.
Two different replication determinants were found on an antibiotic resistance plasmid, pTB19, from a thermophilic bacillus. One replication determinant (designated RepA) was functional only in Bacillus subtilis, whereas the other (designated RepB) functioned in both B. subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus. A deletion plasmid, pTB90, carrying the RepB derived from pTB19 coincidentally contained the specific 1.0 MDal EcoRI fragment of a cryptic plasmid pBSO2 from B. stearothermophilus. The presence of this 1.0 MDal EcoRI fragment in various deletion plasmids from pTB90 increased transformation frequencies for B. stearothermophilus 10(3) to 10(4) times and lowered plasmid copy numbers in the host strain to about one-tenth of those found for plasmids lacking this fragment.
