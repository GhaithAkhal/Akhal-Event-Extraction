De novo sequencing of antimicrobial peptides isolated from the venom glands of the wolf spider Lycosa singoriensis.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), named lycocitin 1, 2 and 3, and a peptide with a monoisotopic molecular mass of 3038.70 Da were detected in the venom glands of the wolf spider Lycosa singoriensis. Two of the peptides, lycocitin 1 and 2, are new AMPs whereas lycocitin 3 is highly homologous to lycotoxin II isolated from the venom of spider Lycosa carolinensis. In addition, two other peptides with monoisotopic masses of 2034.20 and 2340.28 Da showing the motif typical for antimicrobial peptides were also identified. These peptides and lycocitin 1, 2 and 3 were de novo sequenced using electron capture dissociation and low-energy collisional tandem mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence of lycocitin 1 was determined as GKLQAFLAKMKEIAAQTL-NH(2). Lycocitin 2 differs from lycocitin 1 by a replacement of a lysine residue for an arginine residue at the second position. Lycocitin 3 differs from the known lycotoxin II consisting of 27 amino acid residues by a deletion of Gly-26. Both lycocitin 1 and 2 inhibit growth of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) at micromolar concentrations.
