Cecropin P1 and novel nematode cecropins: a bacteria-inducible antimicrobial peptide family in the nematode Ascaris suum.
Cecropin P1 was first identified as a mammalian antimicrobial peptide isolated from the pig intestine. Much research aimed at characterizing this peptide has been reported. Recently, the workers who discovered the peptide corrected their original conclusion, and confirmed that this peptide originates in fact from the pig intestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. In the present study, we carried out a semi-exhaustive search for bacteria-inducible transcripts in A. suum by the cDNA subtraction method. The transcripts encoding cecropin P1 and novel Ascaris cecropins, designated cecropins P2, P3 and P4, were found to be positively induced factors. Chemically synthesized Ascaris cecropins were bactericidal against a wide range of microbes, i.e. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens and Esherichia coli) bacteria, and were weakly but detectably active against yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans). Cecropin P1-like sequences were also detected at least in two other species (Ascaris lumbricoides and Toxocara canis) of the Ascarididae. All Ascaris cecropin precursors contain an acidic pro-region connected by a tetra-basic cleavage site at the C-terminus. Such an acidic pro-region is also reported to be present in the tunicate cecropin-type antimicrobial peptide styelin. On the basis of the evolutionary position of nematodes and tunicates, the ancestral cecropin may have contained the acidic pro-region at the C-terminus.
