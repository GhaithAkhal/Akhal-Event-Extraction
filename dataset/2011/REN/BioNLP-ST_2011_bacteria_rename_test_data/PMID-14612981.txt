A novel splice variant of human gene GDPD1 is mainly expressed in human ovary and small intestine.
Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GDPD) is a glycerol metabolizing enzyme that has been previously identified in Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus subtilis and Borrelia hermsii. It has been also reported that there is putative protein containing GDPD domain in Mus musculus, but not in Homo sapiens. SMART analysis showed that our predicted protein and three others of the same gene also comprise this domain. Because the gene has not been named, we termed it GDPD1 and accordingly termed our splice variant GDPD1_v1 after acquiring the agreement of HUGO. RT-PCR experiment revealed that our splice variant of the gene is mainly expressed in human ovary and small intestine, basically conforming to the result of serial analysis of gene expression.
