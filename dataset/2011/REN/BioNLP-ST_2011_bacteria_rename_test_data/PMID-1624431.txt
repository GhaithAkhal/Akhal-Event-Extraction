Role of the Bacillus subtilis gsiA gene in regulation of early sporulation gene expression.
The Bacillus subtilis gsiA operon was induced rapidly, but transiently, as cells entered the stationary phase in nutrient broth medium. A mutation at the gsiC locus caused sporulation to be defective and expression of gsiA to be elevated and prolonged. The sporulation defect in this strain was apparently due to persistent expression of gsiA, since a gsiA null mutation restored sporulation to wild-type levels. Detailed mapping experiments revealed that the gsiC82 mutation lies within the kinA gene, which encodes the histidine protein kinase member of a two-component regulatory system. Since mutations in this gene caused a substantial blockage in expression of spoIIA, spoIIG, and spoIID genes, it seems that accumulation of a product of the gsiA operon interferes with sporulation by blocking the completion of stage II. It apparently does so by inhibiting or counteracting the activity of KinA.
