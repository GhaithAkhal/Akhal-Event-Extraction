Formation of competent Bacillus subtilis cells.
The process of competent cell formation for transformation has been studied with early-stationary-phase (T1) cells of Bacillus subtilis which had been grown in an enriched Spizizen minimal medium and transferred to a second synthetic medium. Rifampin, chloramphenicol, and tunicamycin were strong inhibitors of competent cell formation, as well as vegetative growth. After formation, competent cells were no longer sensitive to the above agents. Methicillin and an inhibitor of chromosomal replication, hydroxyphenylazouracil, did not inhibit the development of competence. A D-alanine-requiring mutant strain developed competence even in the absence of D-alanine in the second medium. A T1-stage culture showed the activity of extracellular serine protease which is necessary for sporulation. Competent cell formation was completely blocked by 0.7 M ethanol, which is a specific inhibitor of early events during sporulation, including forespore septum formation. Competent cells were formed even in media which supported sporulation. The development of competence was also studied with spo0 mutants at 10 different loci. Most spo0 mutations repressed the development of competence except for spo0C, spo0G, and spo0J. These results suggest that competent cells are formed from early sporulating cells with the synthesis of cell wall materials and by factors whose genes are activated by the supply of nutrients. It is suggested that common steps are involved both in forespore septation and in competent cell formation.
