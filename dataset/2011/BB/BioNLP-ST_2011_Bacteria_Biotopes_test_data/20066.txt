Strain Hxd3 was isolated from the saline water phase of an oil-water separator from a northern German oil field (1,2). Hxd3 is a delta-proteobacterium capable of utilizing C12-C20 alkanes as growth substrates. Alkane degradation in Hxd3 involves the activation of alkanes via carboxylation at C3, with subsequent elimination of the terminal and subterminal carbons. This yields a fatty acid that is one carbon shorter than the parent alkane (3). Hxd3 is the ONLY pure culture that is known to carboxylate aliphatic hydrocarbons.
